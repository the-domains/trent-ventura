Honolulu, HI is where I found my passion; The 8'8" Menehune designed by the late Donald Takayama was by far my first SUP love.  That board was the smallest I could find in Hawaii and surfed like a dream.  I used to SUP surf that board at Log Cabins up on the North Shore.  I wouldn't mind a trek back out to the islands soon...
