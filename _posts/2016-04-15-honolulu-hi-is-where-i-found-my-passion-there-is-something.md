  Honolulu, HI is where I found my passion; The 8'8" Menehune - designed by the
  late Donald Takayama - was by far my first SUP love. That board was the
  smallest I could find in Hawaii, surprisingly at 112L, and surfed like a
  dream. I used to SUP surf that board at Log Cabins up on the North Shore. I
  wouldn't mind a trek back out to the islands soon...
